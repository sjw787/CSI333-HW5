# CSI333-HW5
For this project students were asked to write a program the compresses and decompresses an input file by reading the input file
one character at a time. When the program encounters runs of characters such as the 'll' in hello during compress mode, it will print the ascii 
character that represents the number of repeated characters after the two initial character.
